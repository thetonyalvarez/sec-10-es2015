# SEC 10. ES2015

Each subunit has its own folder.

```
root
└─── subunit-folder/
│    └─── exercise.js
│    └─── exercise.test.js
└─── index.test.html
```

Each subfolder contains a ```.js``` and ```.test.js``` file for that subunit.

All Jasmine testing output is found in the ```index.test.html``` file at the root.

===
### The ```index.test.html``` file

#### For ```10.2 let and const``` subunit:
- Link to [let-const.html](https://github.com/thetonyalvarez/sec-10-es2015/blob/main/10.2%20let%20and%20const/let-const.html) - since this exercise did not have any functions to test and had a **Quiz** portion, I wrote an ```.html``` file to provide the answers to the **Quiz**
#### For all other units:
- Jasmine testing - view all the tests in one place here for all Unit Exercises inside each folder
